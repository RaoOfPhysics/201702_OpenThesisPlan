The best way to do so is to open an [Issue](https://github.com/RaoOfPhysics/201702_OpenThesisPlan/issues) on GitHub, if you:

- spot any typos in the text,
- have a reference that will enhance the robustness of the arguments presented here, or
- come across a [missing citation](https://xkcd.com/285/).

However, please take a look at the closed issues first to make sure that your comment has not already been addressed.

**Please note** that I will not be accepting Pull Requests for this document, nor will I be accepting contributions via Authorea (in the form of comments or merges).
I will of course acknowledge those who contribute via issues to the text.

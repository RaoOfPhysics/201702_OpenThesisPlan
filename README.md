# Out in the open: making the case for writing a doctoral thesis transparently

[![Achintya's PhD repos](https://img.shields.io/badge/collection-Achintya's%20PhD%20repos-yellowgreen.svg)](https://github.com/RaoOfPhysics/phd)

This document is written to justify my plans for open authorship of my PhD thesis, with justifications for this approach intended to address potential concerns with authoring a thesis publicly.

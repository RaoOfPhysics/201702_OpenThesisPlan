This article presents a justification for my desire to write my doctoral thesis as an open document from the early stages of writing, and includes a plan for how this will be achieved. Briefly discussed are the motivations for such an approach, in which I argue that open authoring is more scientifically robust and rigorous than a publication that is only made publicly readable (if at all) at the very end of the writing process. I conclude with some personal reflections on the matter.

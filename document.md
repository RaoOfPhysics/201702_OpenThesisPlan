# Why Open?

The “open science\footnote{The \textit{Encyclopædia Britannica} defines science as “any system of knowledge that is concerned with the physical world and its phenomena and that entails unbiased observations and systematic experimentation”. Source: \url{https://global.britannica.com/topic/science}}” movement has come a long way since it emerged as a movement, in the XXXXs.

Open science encompasses several sub-groups including open access, open data, free/libre and open-source software, open research code, open notebooks etc.
But they could also include open authorship, even at doctoral level:

    - https://github.com/chartgerink/dissertation
    - http://rik.smith-unna.com/phd/thesis.html
    - https://github.com/Tontonis/Thesis_the_second

Here are the arguments I want to make, perhaps aligning with the different “Schools of Open” (http://book.openingscience.org/basics_background/open_science_one_term_five_schools_of_thought.html):

- Pragmatic:
    - Catching typos, missing citations, incorrect references
    - Enhancing authorship by having it scrutinised
- Democratic:
    - Open authoring as a teaching tool and as a subject of study
- Public:
    - Not only does the research need to be accessible, but so does the language!

# How to “do” Open?

## Demonstrating authorship

## The elephant in the room: “third-party advice”

# My open-authoring practices so far

- Conference talks
- Conference proceedings
- Posters
- Book chapters

## Additional “open” elements to the research

- Insistence on using open source
- Sharing code publicly (notebooks)
- Pledge to make data open
- Pledge for all papers to be published under OA licences
